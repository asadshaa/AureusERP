     * The Filament action that calls this is already gated on
     * hr_manage_sensitive_employee_data (->visible()), but that only hides
     * a button -- it doesn't stop this method being called directly (a
     * future API route, an Artisan command, or simply a different UI entry
     * point that forgets the check). Enforcing it here too closes that gap,
     * and mirrors EmployeeRequestService::assertRequestIntegrity()'s own
     * "HR-privileged OR within HR hierarchy scope" rule -- proven by an
     * existing test: HrPlatformTest's "enforces company team and manager
     * hierarchy and audits approved sensitive employee changes" already has
     * a plain manager, not an HR-privileged user, submitting a change for
     * their own direct report, and that has to keep working. This also
     * means an employee can submit a change for themselves (self is always
     * within one's own HrHierarchyService::visibleEmployeeIds() scope, the
     * same "self and reports" concept every other HR self-service screen in
     * this app already uses) -- it still can't take effect without a
     * sensitive_data_custodian's separate approval, so this isn't a way to
     * bypass review. A requester with neither the permission nor HR-scope
     * visibility of this employee at all -- some unrelated user, or someone
     * outside this company -- is refused.
